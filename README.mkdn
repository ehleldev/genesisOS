GenesisOS
===========

Getting started
---------------

To get started with Android/LineageOS, you'll need to get familiar with [Source Control Tools](https://source.android.com/setup/develop).

To initialize your local repository using the LineageOS trees, use a command like this:
```
repo init -u git://github.com/ehleldev/genesisOS.git -b lineage-18.1
```
Then to sync up:
```
repo sync
```
